# Rubric

In business, a rubric is "a scoring guide used to assess the quality of feedback from communities". In simpler terms, it serves as a set of criteria for grading feedback. 

Rubrics include evaluation criteria, definitions of quality for various levels of achievement, and a scoring strategy. 

For business, they play a dual role in reporting feedback and planning work to be done.
